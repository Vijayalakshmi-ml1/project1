I enjoyed learning python programming and concept of object oriented program.mechine learning models such as linear regression,gradient descent,knn,random forest,nayiebase classifier,decision tree.
various libraries such as numpy,pandas which is helpful for methematical computation and working with large data sets.techniques such as pca,encoding ,pipeline creation,column transformer which  helps in data preprocessing.
various visualizing libraries such as seaborn,matplotlib,plotly which hep to se various insights of data and draw meaningful conclusions.I also learnt nlp techniques such as stemming,lemmatization.gained knowledge about
word embeddings,small and large size english models. and word vectors.learnt adout models such as fast text for custom word vectors.
I also enjoyed working with various data sets.and using these models to gain the desired result.
evaluation of model is vary crucial in ml. I have some knowledge about r2 score,adjusted r2 score,f1 score etc..
Thank you
